# **Introduction to the Dataset and Analysis Structure**

The original dataset containing option prices is **`flex_trades_eod_2024-06-20`**, 
located in the folder **`FINAL_TRAIN_DATA_AND_ORIGINAL_DATASET`**. 
This folder also includes the code responsible for importing this dataset and 
calculating historical volatility based on the underlying asset prices.

## **Overview of the Analysis**
The script uses **R** with the following libraries:
- `tidyverse` for data manipulation
- `quantmod` for financial data retrieval
- `Rlof` for outlier detection

### **Key Processing Steps:**
1. **Data Filtering:**
   - Excludes unnecessary symbols
   - Focuses on European-style options (`exercise == "E"`)
2. **Volatility Calculation:**
   - Computes annualized volatility over different time horizons
   - Integrates volatility metrics into the dataset
3. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Applies **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)** to identify anomalies
   - Separates inliers and outliers
   - Ensures a cleaner dataset for further modeling

## **Recommended Analysis Flow**
To ensure a structured exploration, it is advised to follow the analysis 
in the order of the folder organization:

1. **`FINAL_TRAIN_DATA_AND_ORIGINAL_DATASET`** â†’ Data preprocessing & volatility computation
2. **`EXPLORATORY_ANALYSIS`** â†’ Initial statistical analysis
3. **`BLACK_SCHOLES`** â†’ Option pricing models
4. **`MONTECARLO`** â†’ Simulations and risk assessment
5. **`XGBOOST`** â†’ Machine learning models for option pricing

This organization provides a logical progression from raw data preparation
to advanced modeling techniques. ðŸš€
